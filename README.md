## What is this project?

This is a first attempt on creating a Discord bot. It's even my first personal project.
So far i have no clear goal in mind of what the bot can do, or what makes the bot unique. 
The idea for the bot however is that it is set around my interests, so what it could do for example is:

..* Giving fun facts about space, theories about space and the like
..* Sending a random song of the genre you choose
..* Giving reminders about things to do and when
..* Letting people know you want to toke and how high you are
..* And more as soon as i can think of it

## How to add this bot to your server?

I would not suggest just taking over this bot but forking it and altering it so it works best for you. Creating and adding a bot is a simple process that can easily be looked up. 
Furthermore, obviously the config.json isn't ready for use out-of-the-box, it needs to be altered before it can be used by adding a token and a prefix.


## Calling the bot

The prefix is an emote that is exclusive to one of my servers. Fork the bot and alter the config prefix so the bot can be called.

## PS

The language in this bot is dutch, if you really want this one for yourself then feel free to message me and i make a translated version of it.
